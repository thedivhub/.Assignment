       <b> My favourite hobbie is to explore the places which i like  and captured the movement in my camera.</b>
     </p>
     <p>
        <u>I love to travel and take photographs of beautiful  landscapes, architecture, and people. <br> it allows me to express my creativity and share my experiences with others.</u>

<i>
        Travelling not only broadens my horizons but also helps me to relax and rejuvenate. i enjoy meeting new people, trying different cuisines, and learning about various cultures.
